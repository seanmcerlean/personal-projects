# RobotFramework Image Tools

Simple Robot Framework library that wraps the Python Image Library to manipulate and compare images.
Expanded a little but focused on my use case - which is to compare screenshots taken via Selenium on different versions 
of a website for any changes. A threshold can then be set that is worth taking a look for errors.

## Installation

Clone the repository and then either import directly using

Library <path_to_package>/ImageTools

or it should be pip installable

pip install <path_to_package>/robotframework-imagetools
