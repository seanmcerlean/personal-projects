# Python BDD Example

Simple Python BDD Example that shows basic

* Behave
* Selenium Bindings & PageObjects
* ConfigParser

Attempts to log into www.hackthissite.org as a target. Note that the two tests are flakely just to changing error

Requires behave and selenium installed, and geckodriver to be available on the PATH.
